# Build and Update Dist Workflow
#
# Purpose: Automatically rebuilds dist/ when source files change on main
# When: Only runs AFTER code lands on main (triggered by pushes to main)
# Why: The dist/ folder contains the bundled code that GitHub Actions uses
#      when other projects reference this action. It needs to stay in sync
#      with src/ but we don't want developers to manually run build.
#
# Flow:
#   1. Runs tests (safety check, though test.yml should have caught issues)
#   2. Builds dist/ using ncc
#   3. If dist/ changed, creates a new commit and pushes it
#
# This runs AFTER code lands on main, keeping dist up to date automatically.
# The test.yml workflow runs BEFORE code lands on main to validate quality.
