# Test Validation Workflow
#
# Purpose: Validates that tests pass on all pushes and pull requests
# When: Runs on pushes to main AND on all pull requests
# Goal: Catch issues early - should be a required status check to prevent
#       merging broken code
#
# This runs BEFORE code lands on main, ensuring quality.
# The build-dist.yml workflow runs AFTER code lands on main.
